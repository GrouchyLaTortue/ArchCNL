XTEXT and XTEND are used to auto-generate the contents of the `org.architecture.cnl` package. 
This subdirectory contains some files which have been used to generate the latest version (as of 2020-11-30)
of the package. They may serve as a guidance if the generation has to be repeated in the future, e.g. when the
XTEXT or XTEND version is updated.
