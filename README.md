# conformance-checking
Conformance-checking of your rules defined with the CNL against the source code.

- all conformance checking results that have been performed are stored as ontologies
- the evolution of architecture violations can be tracked
- using SPARQL former results can be queried
- results of queries can be integrated into documentation for architecture reviews

This Repository comprises:
* conformance-checking
* StardogConnector

# architecture-to-code-mapper
Maps the architecture concepts and relations to source code elements. Mapping rules are specified as SWRL rules. The mapping is performed using rule-based reasoning.
