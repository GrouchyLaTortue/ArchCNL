# ArchCNL

Central Repository for all projects that are needed for the execution of ArchCNL

## stardog-connector

Connector to the stardog database

## owlify

Representing your software artifacts using semantic web technologies.

## conformance-checking

Conformance-checking of your rules defined with the CNL against the source code.

- all conformance checking results that have been performed are stored as ontologies
- the evolution of architecture violations can be tracked
- using SPARQL former results can be queried
- results of queries can be integrated into documentation for architecture reviews

## architecture-to-code-mapper

Maps the architecture concepts and relations to source code elements. Mapping rules are specified as SWRL rules. The mapping is performed using rule-based reasoning.

## cnl-documentation

Integrates CNL in well-known architecture documentation templates in an asciidoc format, e.g. arc42 and architecture decision records (ADR).

## CNL2OWL

Transform CNL-Rules to OWL Rules

Comprises

- org.architecture.cnl which means the packages and classes generated by XTEND (and by this everything that has former been in repository org.architecture.cnl.parent)
- jens-api packages, that use the NLPfunctionality of the stanford-nlp project (nd by this everything that has former been in repositoryjens-api).

## cnl-common

Repository with common datatypes for the cnl toolchain.

## cnl-toolchain

Combines all components that are necessary for performing conformance checking to a toolchain. 
Toolchain will be started in this project.
